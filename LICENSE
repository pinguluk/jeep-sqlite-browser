Version 1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 pingluluk

This license applies to the source code and other contents of this repository (the "Software"),
except where a file or dependency clearly states different terms.

1. Definitions
- "You" means any person or entity exercising rights under this license.
- "Redistribute" means to publish, upload, share, distribute, or make available to others,
  by any means, including hosting on a website, repo, store, or file sharing service.
- "Modified Version" means the Software with any changes.
- "Substantial Changes" are changes that meet the requirements in section 3.

2. Permissions
You may:
(a) Use the Software for personal, educational, and research purposes.
(b) Fork the repository and modify the Software.

3. Substantial Changes requirement (redistribution gate)
You may Redistribute a Modified Version only if it includes Substantial Changes.

"Substantial Changes" means the Modified Version does at least one of the following:
(A) Fixes a real functional bug (not just formatting or comments); OR
(B) Adds a new user-visible feature (a behavior change a user can notice or use); OR
(C) Makes a meaningful security or privacy improvement (for example: reduces permissions,
    removes data collection, fixes a security bug, or mitigates a vulnerability).

The following are NOT Substantial Changes by themselves:
- renaming the project, changing branding, icons, donate link or extension listing text
- README-only or documentation-only edits
- formatting, linting, refactoring with no behavior change
- changing build scripts or configs without changing behavior

4. No redistribution of unmodified copies

- include a link to the original repository in a prominent place (README and/or about page)

6. ShareAlike (same license on derivatives)
If you Redistribute a Modified Version, you must license your Modified Version under this
same license text, without removing or weakening any restrictions.

"Commercial purposes" include, but are not limited to:

- monetizing it primarily through ads, affiliate revenue, sponsorship placements, or
  other revenue tied to distribution or usage of the Software

8. Extension stores and marketplaces (no publishing without permission)

Modified Version) on any browser extension store or marketplace without prior written

9. Required notice of changes
If you Redistribute a Modified Version, you must:
